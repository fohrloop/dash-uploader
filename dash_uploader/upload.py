    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    text: str
        The text to show in the upload "Drag
        and Drop" area. Optional.
    text_completed: str
        The text to show in the upload area 
        after upload has completed succesfully before
        the name of the uploaded file. For example, if user
        uploaded "data.zip" and `text_completed` is 
        "Ready! ", then user would see text "Ready! 
        data.zip".
    cancel_button: bool
        If True, shows a cancel button.
    pause_button: bool
        If True, shows a pause button.
    filetypes: list of str or None
        The filetypes that can be uploaded. 
        For example ['zip', 'rar'].
        Note that this just checks the extension of the 
        filename, and user might still upload any kind 
        of file (by renaming)!
        By default, all filetypes are accepted.
    max_file_size: numeric
        The maximum file size in Megabytes. Optional.
    default_style: None or dict
        Inline CSS styling for the main div element. 
        If None, use the default style of the component.
        If dict, will use the union on the given dict
        and the default style. (you may override
        part of the style by giving a dictionary)
        More styling options through the CSS classes.
    upload_id: None or str
        The upload id, created with uuid.uuid1() or uuid.uuid4(), 
        for example. If none, creates random session id with
        uuid.uuid1().
    max_files: int (default: 1)
        EXPERIMENTAL feature. Read below. For bulletproof
        implementation, force usage of zip files and keep
        max_files = 1.
        
        The number of files that can be added to 
        the upload field simultaneously.

        Notes: 
        (1) If even a single file which is not supported file
         type, is added to the upload queue, upload process of
         all files will be permanently interrupted. 
        (2) Use reasonably small amount in "max_files". 
        (3) When uploading two folders with Chrome, there is 
         a bug in resumable.js which makes only one of the
         folders to be uploaded. See:
         https://github.com/23/resumable.js/issues/416
        (4) When uploading folders, note that the subdirectories
          are NOT created -> All files in the folders will
          be uploaded to the single upload folder.

    Returns
    -------
    Upload: dash component
        Initiated Dash component for app.layout.
