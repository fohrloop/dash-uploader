    Parameters:
    ----------
    #1 The element with the drag and drop area.
    #2 Drop offset x relative to the top/left corner of the drop area. Center if 0.
    #3 Drop offset y relative to the top/left corner of the drop area. Center if 0.

    Returns:
    -------
    A file <input> element used for simulating drag and drop.
